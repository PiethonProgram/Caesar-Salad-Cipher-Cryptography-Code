# Assignment 3.

The point of this code is to take in a file for encryption or decryption and subsequently provide the completed encrypted or decrypted text.

## design decisions

For this program, I decided to elaborate on my earlier program and change some minor things. Following the assignment, I coded for the
program to encode/decode by each word in each line. I also coded so that if my if/then statement found a symbol (not a-z/A-Z), then
it would do nothing and just put the symbol into the sequence. Finally, I programmed the function to call for an input file and to 
check if it exists.


## documented limitations

One limitation of my program is that it doesn't do anything when you put letters/symbols other than E or D into the process.
Another limitation to the program is that it doesn't take in options beyond Y or N for repetitions.

## future improvements

To improve my program in the future, I plan on using additional while loops and if/else functions to ensure that the limitations above
are fixed. This may include running the if/else statement in a while loop until a proper letter is chosen, or just ending the program
using an else statement.
